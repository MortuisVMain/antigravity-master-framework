# Web quality audit

Comprehensive quality review based on Google Lighthouse audits. Covers Performance, Accessibility, SEO, and Best Practices across 150+ checks.

## How it works

1. Analyze the provided code/project for quality issues
2. Categorize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Provide specific, actionable recommendations
4. Include code examples for fixes

## Audit categories

### Performance (40% of typical issues)

**Core Web Vitals** вЂ” Must pass for good page experience:
* **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s.** The largest visible element must render quickly. Optimize images, fonts, and server response time.
* **INP (Interaction to Next Paint) < 200ms.** User interactions must feel instant. Reduce JavaScript execution time and break up long tasks.
* **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1.** Content must not jump around. Set explicit dimensions on images, embeds, and ads.

**Resource Optimization:**
* **Compress images.** Use WebP/AVIF with fallbacks. Serve correctly sized images via `srcset`.
* **Minimize JavaScript.** Remove unused code. Use code splitting. Defer non-critical scripts.
* **Optimize CSS.** Extract critical CSS. Remove unused styles. Avoid `@import`.
* **Efficient fonts.** Use `font-display: swap`. Preload critical fonts. Subset to needed characters.

**Loading Strategy:**
* **Preconnect to origins.** Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for third-party domains.
* **Preload critical assets.** LCP images, fonts, and above-fold CSS.
* **Lazy load below-fold content.** Images, iframes, and heavy components.
* **Cache effectively.** Long cache TTLs for static assets. Immutable caching for hashed files.

### Accessibility (30% of typical issues)

**Perceivable:**
* **Text alternatives.** Every `<img>` has meaningful `alt` text. Decorative images use `alt=""`.
* **Color contrast.** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA).
* **Don't rely on color alone.** Use icons, patterns, or text alongside color indicators.
* **Captions and transcripts.** Video has captions. Audio has transcripts.

**Operable:**
* **Keyboard accessible.** All functionality available via keyboard. No keyboard traps.
* **Focus visible.** Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements.
* **Skip links.** Provide "Skip to main content" for keyboard users.
* **Sufficient time.** Users can extend time limits. No auto-advancing content without controls.

**Understandable:**
* **Page language.** Set `lang` attribute on `<html>`.
* **Consistent navigation.** Same navigation structure across pages.
* **Error identification.** Form errors clearly described and associated with fields.
* **Labels and instructions.** All form inputs have associated labels.

**Robust:**
* **Valid HTML.** No duplicate IDs. Properly nested elements.
* **ARIA used correct
